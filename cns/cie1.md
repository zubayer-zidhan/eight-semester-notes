# Network Security
Network Security is any activity designed to protect the usability and integrity of network and data.
- includes both hardware and software technologies
- targets a variety of threats
- stops from entering or spreading on network
- effective network security manage access to network


## Malware Types
- Malware is short form malicious software
- Malware is an umbrella term used to refer to a variety of forms of hostile or 
intrusive software including Ransom wares, Computer Viruses, Worms, 
Trojan Horses, Spyware, Adware, Scareware etc
- can be deployed remotely, tracking the source is hard



### Virus
- contagious program or code that attaches itself to another piece of software, and then reproduces itself when that software is run.

### Worm
- A program that replicates itself and destroys data and files on the computer.
- "eats" the system operating files and data files until drive is empty.

### Trojan
- type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software.
- written with purpose of discovering financial info, taking over system resources, "DOS attack"

### Ransomware


### Spam
- method of flooding the Internet with copies of the same message
- most "spams" are commercial advertisements



# Cryptography
- can reformat and transform data, making it safer on its trip between computers.
- based on the essentials of secret codes, augmented by mordern mathematics that protects our data in powerful ways.


### Computer Security
- generic name for the collection of tooles designed to protect data and to thwart hackers

### Network Security
- measures to protect data during their transmission

### Internet Security
- measures to protect data during their transmission over a collection of interconnected networks

## Security Attacks, Services and Mechanisms
To assess the security needs of an org effectively, the manager responsible for security needs some systematic way of defining the reqs for security and characterization of approaches to satisfy those reqs. 

### Three aspects of information security:
**Security Attack:** Any action that compromises the security of info owned by an org.
**Security Mechanism:** A mechanism that is designed to detect, prevent or recover from a security attack.
**Security Service:** A service that enhances the security of the data processing systems and the info transfers of an organization.


Network security is protection of the access to files and directories in a computer 
network against hacking, misuse and unauthorized changes to the system.

Ex: The authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network 
administrator. Users are assigned an ID and password that allows them access to 
information and programs within their authority



## Definitions:
Cryptography
- The art or science encompassing the principles and methods of transforming an intelligible message into one that is unintelligible, and then retransforming that message back to its original form

Plaintext 
- The original intelligible message

Cipher text
- The transformed message

Cipher
- An algorithm for transforming an intelligible message into one that is unintelligible by
 transposition and/or substitution methods

Key
- Some critical information used by the cipher, known only to the sender& receiver

Encipher (encode)
- The process of converting plaintext to cipher text using a cipher and a key

Decipher (decode)
- the process of converting cipher text back into plaintext using a cipher and a key

Cryptanalysis
- The study of principles and methods of transforming an unintelligible message back into an intelligible message without knowledge of the key. Also called code breaking

Cryptology
- Both cryptography and cryptanalysis

Code
- An algorithm for transforming an intelligible message into an unintelligible one using a code-book
